[^1]: The host never frees memory (is never passed ownership)!

[^2]: A wit::string is identical to the canonical representation, so it can be part of structures. On the guest a wit::string owns the memory and frees it after use.
On the host a wit::string can be constructed(=allocated) with an exec_env argument. Thus, without an exec_env a wit::string on the host is inaccessible.
Complex (non-POD) struct elements on the host will need exec_env to decode or construct.

[^3]: A wit::string requires exec_env inside the host implementation. ~~Perhaps a flexible type (either std::string or wit::string would be possible), or make this a generation option?~~ std::string requires a copy, wit::string requires passing exec_env to the method (which is necessary for methods anyway).

[^4]: A host side wit::string doesn't own the data (not free in dtor), thus no move semantics.

[^5]: std::span requires C++-20, this alias should give minimal functionality with older compiler targets.

# Symmetric ABI

The idea is to directly connect (link) components to each other.

Thus imported and exported functions and resources need to be compatible
at the ABI level.

For now for functions the following convention is used in both directions:

 - The imported function ABI is used with the following properties

    - (unchanged) List and string arguments are passed as Views, no free
      required, lifetime is constrained until the end of the call

    - (unchanged) Owned resources in arguments or results pass ownership
      to the callee

    - (unchanged) If there are too many (>1) flat results, a local
      uninitialized ret_area is passed via the last argument

    - (change) Returned strings and lists become views, valid until a
      cabi_post on the ret_area ptr which was passed to the first call.
      This is mostly a concession to functional safety, avoiding all
      allocations in the hot path. Caller provided buffers or custom realloc
      would solve this in a different way.

 - The imported resource ABI is used also for exporting
   with one modification:

   Resource IDs are usize, so you can optimize the resource table away.
